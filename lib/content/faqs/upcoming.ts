// HAND-AUTHORED FAQ content for Pokémon TCG sets the generator can't reach.
//
// The released-set FAQs are computed from the cache DB (see registry.ts). A set
// only lands in that DB once pokemontcg.io publishes its cards, so there's
// always a gap — often months — where a set is announced, or even already on
// shelves, and we still have no card data for it. These pages cover that gap:
// written from verified official reveals + TCG news, stamped with the date the
// copy was last checked, and honest about what isn't known rather than guessing.
// Every page links its sources (E-E-A-T).
//
// Two lifecycle stages live here, and `releaseDate` vs `checkedOn` decides which
// standing note a page carries (see `footer()`):
//   - announced, not out yet     → "pre-release, details can still change"
//   - out, but not in the cache  → "released; figures are from the announcements"
//
// HAND-OFF: once a set enters the cache DB and `scripts/build-faqs.mjs` is
// re-run, the data-driven templates cover it. registry.ts dedupes by slug (the
// hand-authored page wins) so nothing ever breaks; prune the entry here when the
// live data beats the hand-written copy.
//
// Two things that pruning taught us, when Pitch Black made the trip in August
// 2026 — budget for both before deleting a block:
//
//  1. The dedupe only bites on slugs matching the template scheme in slug.ts.
//     Anything else — a slug that predates the scheme, or a question no template
//     asks — is an indexed URL with no successor, and deleting it 404s. Pitch
//     Black left six behind. They are redirected in next.config.ts; send yours
//     to the closest surviving page, or to the set's `/faqs/set/<id>` hub.
//  2. Templates only answer what card data can answer. Set identity, sub-themes,
//     Build & Battle promos and product line-ups have no data-driven twin, so
//     that copy is retired rather than replaced. That is a content call, not a
//     mechanical one — make it deliberately.
//
// NOTHING IN THIS FILE READS THE CLOCK. It exposes `hasReleased(set, today)`
// and leaves "now" to registry.ts, which reads it per request — see the
// "WHERE NOW COMES FROM" note there. Release-driven expiry (dropping a set from
// "coming soon" once its date passes) is that file's job, not this one's.

The English set was officially revealed on August 20, 2026, confirming four Mega ex headliners — **Mega Rayquaza ex**, **Mega Golisopod ex**, **Mega Golurk ex** and **Mega Malamar ex** — plus six further Pokémon ex and a new **split Stadium** mechanic: three paired Legendary Stadium cards (six cards total) that combine into one Stadium when both halves are in play. PokéGuardian reports the set at **over 135 cards**, though Pokémon hasn't published a final numbered checklist. English product pricing is confirmed (Elite Trainer Boxes, Booster Display Boxes and more), but an exact release-day card list isn't out yet.",
